# Fitness-App-Animations

## About
The goal of this project was to use the basic UX rules of animation and implement at least three animations into the design of a fitness app. This fitness app is a skiing app based off of starva the aninmations included were delights for liking a photo and being congratulated for completing another task. As well as animations for the photo expanding as you click it and a card swipe to begin recording a new session.

## Learnings
Through this project I was able to start dipping my toes in the water with using Adobe After Effects. Although I ultimatley used figma to complete the animations I found exploring with After Effects to be helpful in my journey as I continue to expand my UX skills. Aslo being able to learn about the different "rules" with animation within UX was helpful for me to create meaningful animations that weren't there just for the looks or gimmics but to actually serve a purpose. 

## Tools Used
Figma and Adobe After Effects
